## Goals

* Serve static SEO-friendly content alongside interactive front-end SPAs
* One single deployable application, trivially containerized, trivially deployed anywhere
* A single file-based router with minimal coupling
* Front-end and back-end technology agnostic: no heavy-weight laundry list of features, just what you need to get deployed and executing as fast as possible
