# Dex.ts

A TypeScript first, SSR capable, backend+frontend framework: a bare next.js.

## Goals

* Serve static SEO-friendly content alongside interactive front-end SPAs
* One single deployable application, trivially containerized, trivially deployed anywhere
* A simple file-based router with minimal coupling
* Front-end and back-end technology agnostic: no laundry list of features

Dex.ts was designed after many iterations and technologies across a myriad of fast-paced startup projects.

Its primary aim is to be just what you need to get deployed and executing as fast as possible, with minimal baggage.

## Packages

`dex.ts` - the framework

`hn-demo` - the example application

Eventually dex.ts will be published to npm.
